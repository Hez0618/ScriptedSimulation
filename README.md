**ScriptedSimulation** is an AI-driven NPC behavior simulation set in a narrative-driven environment inspired by classic murder mysteries like *Murder on the Orient Express*.  

On the first day, all NPCs harbor their own grudges and motives against the soon-to-be victim — Marcus. As the day unfolds, each character secretly initiates a plan. By nightfall, Marcus is dead.

But the twist? Everyone has something to hide.

NPCs now begin to interact with each other, investigate, cover their own tracks, and try to uncover what others have done — all powered by a dynamic AI behavior system.
