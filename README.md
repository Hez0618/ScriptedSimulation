## 🧩 Overview

**ScriptedSimulation** is a multi-agent narrative simulator where every NPC has its own motive, plan, and behavior.  
Set on a moving train, all characters secretly orchestrate their actions on Day One — culminating in the shocking murder of Marcus.

But the real story begins after his death.

NPCs now explore, cover their tracks, interrogate each other, and piece together the truth — all powered by dynamic AI behavior models.
